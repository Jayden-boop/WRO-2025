Engineering materials
=====

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2025.




# Introduction

## Engineering Materials

### 1\. Raspberry Pi 5

Why:  
The Raspberry Pi 5 serves as the vehicle’s "brain," providing the computational power required for autonomous navigation and real-time decision-making. Its quad-core CPU and GPIO capabilities support complex tasks like sensor fusion (e.g., camera data, ultrasonic sensors) and path-planning algorithms.



### 2\. Raspberry Pi 5 Expansion Board

Why:  
The expansion board simplifies wiring, ensuring stable power distribution and modular sensor/motor integration. This reduces electrical noise and debugging time during high-pressure rounds.



### 3\. Micro Servo 99 SG90

Why:  
The SG90 is a lightweight, precise servo for steering control. Its 180° range and torque (1.8 kg/cm) allow accurate turns while adhering to the vehicle’s size/weight limits (Rule 11.1: ≤300x200mm, ≤1.5kg).


### 4\. K989 1/28 WL Toys Chassis

Why:  
This modular RC chassis provides a pre-built 4-wheeled platform with a differential drive system. While Rule 11.3 prohibits differential wheeled robots, the chassis can be modified to use a single steering actuator (SG90) and compliant drive system (Furitek motor \+ gearbox).



### 5\. Furitek Micro Komodo Motor

Why:  
This brushless motor delivers high torque and smooth speed control in a compact package. It powers the drive axle via a gear system, ensuring efficient navigation of variable track widths (600–1000mm) and slopes.
